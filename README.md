This repository demonstrates a common source of undefined behavior in Rust: modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer after potential reallocations. The original code uses `as_mut_ptr()` to obtain a raw pointer to the vector's data and then modifies the data directly using unsafe code. However, this is unsafe because the vector's capacity may change, invalidating the pointer. The solution demonstrates a safe approach using vector indexing or iterators.
